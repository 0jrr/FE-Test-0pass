”Art Library” assessment

Objective:
Develop a single-page application using React that simulates a virtual art gallery. The application should allow users to browse different works of art, learn more about them, and even curate their own virtual exhibitions.

Core Requirements:
1. Artwork Browsing: The application should retrieve and display a collection of artworks from the provided API. Each artwork should display its image, title, and artist.

2. Artwork Details: Users should be able to click on an artwork to view more detailed information, such as its creation date, medium, dimensions, and a brief description or history.

3. Responsive Design: The application should be mobile-friendly and look great on both small and large screens.

Tech Stack: The use of React is mandatory. However, you are free to choose any other technologies, libraries, or frameworks that you prefer for state management, routing, styling, etc.

Optional (Bonus) Tasks:
1. Virtual Exhibition: Users can curate their own virtual exhibitions by selecting a collection of artworks. These collections should be save-able and viewable later.

2. Artwork Search and Filter: Implement search and filter functionalities. Users should be able to search for artworks by artist and filter based on whatever parameters you choose (check API response to determine available fields).

3. Artwork Scrolling Pagination: As a user scrolls to the bottom past the last piece of artwork, automatically load in the next batch of artwork, keep design in mind here.

4. User Interface Animation: Implement subtle animations when browsing the gallery and viewing artworks to make the user experience more engaging and interactive.

Evaluation Criteria:
You will be evaluated based on:

1. The functionality of your application

2. The design, aesthetic, and user experience of your application

3. Your choice of technologies, libraries, or frameworks

4. Code quality, organization, and readability

5. If and how you chose to implement the optional tasks
